# TranslationtoHinglish
This Python project utilizes the Hugging Face Transformers library to create a powerful Hinglish translator. It can take English sentences as input and provide translations in Hinglish. What makes this translator unique is the ability to replace specific Hindi words with their English counterparts while keeping the rest of the sentence in Hindi.
